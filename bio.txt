Garrett Woodworth, better known as GWoo, is a passionate open source developer,
user experience producer and systems engineer.

He gained the respect of many developers, as project manager of CakePHP,
where he focused on usability, architecture and community development. GWoo continues
innovating application frameworks with Lithium, the most RAD PHP framework. In addition,
he follows development of user interface tools and works on projects related to devops.

He has developed systems with PHP, Ruby, Python, Javascript, and still loves shell
scripting. He values test driven development and looks to promote better quality software
through process and tooling. Currently, he enjoys Go, Angular.js, Couchbase, ZeroMQ, and
Clouds.

Currently, GWoo is developing open source software while advising startups and
enterprises. Most recently, he was involved with Infrastructure as a Service while
VP of Engineering and Product Management at Blue Box Group, Inc. Previously, he
focused on Platform as a Service while engineering user experience and distributed
systems at EngineYard, Inc. Before entering the clouds, he was VP of Product and
Engineering at Geeknet working on SourceForge and Slashdot.

Gwoo holds a bachelor's degree in history from the University of Hawaii and a JD/MBA from
Fordham University, where he studied intellectual property and information systems. When
not jetting around the world speaking at conferences, he's on a boat. Don't you ever forget.
